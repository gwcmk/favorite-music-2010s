              <h5>Mitski, "Your Best American Girl" (2015)</h5>

              <p>
                No song spoke so personally to my experiences and struggles this
                decade than Mitski‚Äôs ‚ÄúYour Best American Girl‚Äù. At the start of
                this decade I was living in Minnesota, the only Asian student at
                my high school and one of few POC in the whole community. This
                wasn‚Äôt something that bothered me at the time, having been
                raised in a community that truly believed that we lived in a
                post-racial world and society. I had fully bought in and viewed
                myself as an ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù through and through, though if you
                pressed me, I‚Äôm not sure I even knew what that meant. Like so
                many other second generation Asian Americans, I was shielded
                from most of the more overt and clearly malicious aspects of
                white supremacy, but in that process, I internalized a lot of
                racist ideology. I think it‚Äôs really natural for kids to want to
                fit in with their peers, and that innocent desire changes how
                you think about yourself, your ethnicity, and your culture.
                Coming to terms with your otherness while longing for acceptance
                is so painful and confusing. Mitski expresses that so well in
                this song:
              </p>
              <p class="quote">
                <em>
                  Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me<br />
                  But I do, I think I do<br />
                  And you're an all-American boy<br />
                  I guess I couldn't help trying to be your best American girl
                </em>
              </p>
              <p>
                ‚ÄúYour Best American Girl‚Äù feels like such a journey, providing
                catharsis and release for anyone who‚Äôs experienced these
                feelings. It wraps up perfectly with my favorite part of this
                song, the slight change that she makes in the final chorus.
              </p>
              <p class="quote">
                <em>
                  Your mother wouldn't approve of how my mother raised me<br />
                  <strong>But I do, I finally do </strong>
                </em>
              </p>
              <p>
                I had both the highest highs and lowest lows of my life in the
                past few years, and through all of that, I return to this.
                Mitski is my favorite artist of the decade because she writes
                about self-acceptance in a way that resonates with me and many
                others like me.

              <h5>Future, "March Madness" (2015)</h5>

              <p>
                Future‚Äôs series of mixtapes leading up to <em>DS2</em> was an
                incredible run, and ‚ÄúMarch Madness‚Äù is the standout track of the
                bunch. At first glance, this era of his music seems to be a
                shameless dive into hedonism. Nearly every track mentions
                borderline abuse of drugs and alcohol, typically under the guise
                of nihilism. However, listening to these mixtapes in their
                entirety, a fuller picture comes into focus. Cracks in his armor
                betray deep sadness, particularly on tracks like ‚ÄúCodeine Crazy‚Äù
                and ‚ÄúThrow Away.‚Äù
              </p>
              <p>
                While I can‚Äôt relate to his struggles, I think any straight man
                raised to aspire to toxic masculine ideals understands the
                pressure to hide those emotions, and that‚Äôs the undercurrent of
                his music that really resonated with me in 2015 when these
                mixtapes were coming out. I was grappling with anxiety and
                depression and was not emotionally mature enough to fully
                understand and process how I was feeling. ‚ÄúMarch Madness‚Äù
                captures the full range of these experiences. Just within the
                hook, he goes from drugs as an escape (‚ÄúDirty soda in a
                styrofoam/Spend a day to get my mind blown‚Äù), violence and
                paranoia (‚ÄúShoot a nigga like a film in a movie/Nigga, gone let
                'em have it‚Äù), to worrying about police brutality (Ballin' like
                the March Madness/All these cops shooting niggas, tragic‚Äù).
                Regardless of what you‚Äôre going through, there are times when
                seemingly too many things pile up. Future is one of the best at
                expressing what it‚Äôs like trying to appear cool through that
                overwhelming feeling of anxiety.

              <h5>Carly Rae Jepsen, "Cut to the Feeling" (2017)</h5>

              <p>
                Honesty and positivity are two of the biggest mantras of Carly‚Äôs
                music and it‚Äôs been such a source of inspiration for me
                throughout this decade. I had an internship in the summer of
                2015, and I have so many memories of listening to
                <em>Emotion</em> at work or walking around Chicago. To be
                honest, I wasn‚Äôt in a good place mentally at the time, but in
                those moments Carly‚Äôs music genuinely brought me hope and
                optimism. The missing link was that I wasn‚Äôt sure why. I think
                of that summer as the first time in my life when I started to be
                honest with myself about how I felt, and I credit her music with
                helping me better understand my own feelings. ‚ÄúCut to the
                Feeling‚Äù makes me feel the energy of wanting to find the joy in
                life and just going for it. Back then, If you asked me what I
                thought of that, I‚Äôd probably think it‚Äôs a bit immature. Now
                though, I can‚Äôt think of anything more important.

            <li>
              <h5>Young Thug, "Halftime" (2015)</h5>

              <p>
                Anyone who knows me and has talked to me about rap knows that I
                think Young Thug is an icon of our time. As we close out the
                decade, his influence is everywhere. Despite all of the
                imitators though, no one is quite like him. He effortlessly
                rides any kind of beat, adding his own unique flair to every
                song he‚Äôs on. What he may lack in heady lyricism, he makes up
                for with otherworldly, innovative flows and memorable lines.

              <h5>Kanye West, "New Slaves" (2013)</h5>

              <p>
                At the beginning of the decade, I thought Kanye was a creative
                genius and the greatest hip hop artist of all time, and my
                arguments for it are all on display in ‚ÄúNew Slaves.‚Äù Most of my
                opinions were formed regarding craft rather than culture, and
                this song, along with the rest of <em>Yeezus</em>, is
                masterfully made. Kanye and his producers put together sparse
                instrumentals that serve as an excellent backdrop for Kanye‚Äôs
                raw and gritty vocals. The collaborator and sample choice
                throughout is also great. The outro of ‚ÄúNew Slaves‚Äù pairs Frank
                Ocean and a sample of 60s Hungarian rock song, and it‚Äôs a
                surprisingly perfect fit for this song. I never would have
                guessed that the guy who made this song would one day be a
                Republican shill who speaks at mega churches, but unfortunately
                that‚Äôs where we‚Äôre at. In spite of him tarnishing his legacy,
                this song, along with the rest of Yeezus, stands as a testament
                to his talent, taste, and skill. It‚Äôs a powerful, passionate
                statement that will stick with me for many more years to come.

              <h5>Charli XCX &amp; Christine and the Queens, "Gone" (2019)</h5>

              <p>
                One of my favorite things to follow in the latter half of this
                decade was Charli XCX‚Äôs string of projects, starting with her
                <em>Vroom Vroom EP</em> in early 2016, which were a creative
                partnership between her and PC Music‚Äôs founder A.G. Cook. ‚ÄúGone‚Äù
                feels like a culmination of that era. Incorporating a lot of the
                harsh electronic sounds from PC Music‚Äôs aesthetic, Charli‚Äôs
                music started sounding more futuristic. I loved these songs
                stylistically but even more so because they complemented her
                greatest strength, her songwriting. Through all of the glitches
                and synths, her songs are so human. ‚ÄúGone‚Äù does this best,
                exploring the intersection of love, insecurity, and social
                anxiety. That specific combination of feelings is so crippling,
                but overcoming it feels so good. I think she said it best
                herself:
              </p>
              <p class="quote">
                ‚ÄúBoth this song and video are a huge release of energy for me.
                When I hear it and when I dance to it I feel truly euphoric and
                alive, like I‚Äôm pushing out all the bad feelings from my brain.
                [It‚Äôs] like I‚Äôm channeling all my anger and frustration (and
                sometimes sadness) into dancing it all away.‚Äù

              <p>
                One of the biggest changes in my music taste during this decade
                was my increasing love for pop. There‚Äôs something so universal
                and freeing about a good pop song. The world sucks sometimes and
                we often look for ways to escape, and I find pop to be one of
                the most pure feelings of release that you can find in music.
                Charli is one of the best at chasing that feeling, and that‚Äôs
                why she‚Äôs one of my favorite artists of the decade.

              <h5>Chance the Rapper (feat. Saba), "Angels" (2015)</h5>

              <p>
                Before Gen Z grew up, all young millennials can remember when
                cynicism was the norm. Chance the Rapper challenged that with so
                much joy that even we couldn‚Äôt deny it. I think one of the main
                reasons it worked was because he wasn‚Äôt just happy for the sake
                of it, it was really grounded in reality. ‚ÄúAngels‚Äù is my
                favorite song of his because it is my favorite example of that.
                It‚Äôs such a fun song, first going on a tour of his Chicago
                roots, but when it gets real (‚ÄúIt's too many young angels on the
                southside/Got us scared to let our grandmommas outside‚Äù), it‚Äôs
                so heartbreaking. It makes the refrain ‚ÄúWear your halo like a
                hat, that's like the latest fashion/I got angels all around me,
                they keep me surrounded‚Äù that much more powerful.
              </p>
              <p>
                Chance raps and sings honestly about what is happening around
                him in Chicago, and faced with those harsh realities, he chooses
                to follow the light and seek out love. His love for God, his
                family, friends, and the city of Chicago is so pure and that‚Äôs
                what really shines through in his music. I have a very vivid
                memory of walking alone after studying late at night (down Noyes
                coming from Mudd back to my apartment), not feeling good about
                much in life, and I listened to this song for the first time. In
                that moment, I had a rising sense of optimism in my chest, a
                feeling that everything will be alright. That‚Äôs a precious
                feeling, and I have ‚ÄúAngels‚Äù to thank for that.

              <p>
                I spent a lot of time following Young Thug‚Äôs career between 1017
                Thug and Jeffrey, and a huge part of that was a ton of singles,
                loosies, and leaks. Out of all of the canceled and scrapped
                Young Thug projects over the decade, I‚Äôm most disappointed that
                we never got Metro Thuggin :(

              <h5>HYUNA, "Bubble Pop!" (2011)</h5>

              <p>
                K-pop has played a pretty interesting and unexpected role in my
                life throughout this past decade, and it started with this song.
                I don‚Äôt know exactly when I first heard ‚ÄúBubble Pop!‚Äù, but I
                remember liking it. I thought it was catchy, even though I
                didn‚Äôt understand any of the lyrics. I intuitively knew that I
                couldn‚Äôt share this with any of my friends though. They would
                think it‚Äôs so weird!
              </p>
              <p>
                I continued to listen to this song and eventually more K-pop
                songs that I liked, but I also continued to be ashamed of it. A
                few months (or maybe a year?) later ‚ÄúGangnam Style‚Äù blew up
                around the world, and my high school was included in that mania.
                This seemed like a good opportunity to start to admit that I
                liked a few K-pop songs, and my friends didn‚Äôt think much of it.
                Despite that, this was still a source of discomfort for me.
              </p>
              <p>
                I can‚Äôt really explain why, but I somehow just swept under the
                rug that I had this deep shame about liking something that‚Äôs so
                clearly foreign, even though it‚Äôs literally from the country
                where my family is from. Bottling up that shame and self
                deprecation drove a lot of insecurity and anxiety in my life,
                and when I finally got around to acknowledging that, my fandom
                of K-pop was really important. It was such a blatant example of
                how I had internalized racism and white supremacy and how those
                power structures had become pillars in my worldview. It‚Äôs kinda
                silly in retrospect that this fun pop song was a catalyst for
                something so important, but in the following years, I‚Äôve come to
                enjoy more K-pop songs in the process of becoming more accepting
                of my racial and cultural identity.
              </p>
              <p>
                A few other notes about why I genuinely think this song is gr8:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  HyunA really pushed boundaries and set the stage for current
                  and future generations of female K-pop stars, challenging
                  outdated standards of acceptability.
                </li>
                <li>
                  She also has the solo star power that many idols can‚Äôt
                  capitalize on because of being part of a group. She set the
                  precedent for her style of music, and we‚Äôre seeing the
                  influence of that today.

                  The dubstep breakdown is pretty funny and borderline absurd
                  now, but that kind of exploration of western trends, as long
                  as it‚Äôs not appropriative, is a fun part of modern K-pop that
                  I enjoy.

                  Many K-pop singles commit to concepts and fully go for them.
                  When it doesn‚Äôt it the mark, they can come of as kitschy or
                  melodramatic, but when songs like this do it well, that kind
                  of maximalism produces some of the best pop songs.

              <p>
                I have a tendency to overthink things, and that was even more
                common when I was younger. For music, I often felt like I needed
                to be able to explain why I liked something or else it didn‚Äôt
                make sense. I remember Skrillex actually challenging me in this
                regard. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm alone in Skrillex being the first
                dubstep that I had ever heard. It was harsh sounding and almost
                painful to listen to, compared to the other EDM I listened to at
                the time. In my opinion, it didn‚Äôt really have many musical
                qualities. Despite that, I liked it. Now that I‚Äôm older and have
                listened to a lot more music, I have plenty of reasons why I
                think Skrillex made good music and innovated in major ways. The
                absence of those explanations was important for me though,
                because I credit my love of this song as a teen for opening my
                mind to weirder things. I didn‚Äôt really know why I liked this
                song, but that didn‚Äôt matter. I just needed to find something
                that went as HARD as this shit, and for the next 9 years that
                became a huge part of my life, teaching me to follow my feelings
                more than my thoughts.

                are what got me into grime. I had heard a few grime songs
                before, but ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs Not Me‚Äù really made it click for me. The
                lofi setup felt really underground and genuine even though I
                didn‚Äôt know anything about the scene, and the raps sound like
                radio freestyles (in a good way). A random bit that‚Äôs stuck with
                me since then is that you can use headphones as a mic (lol).

              <p>
                I‚Äôve seen this song at Chance‚Äôs shows many times now, but two of
                those shows really stayed with me. In the lead up to
                <em>Coloring Book</em>, Chance had so much support in Chicago
                from all different kinds of people. I was at Towkio‚Äôs show for
                his debut mixtape, and Chance showed up to perform this song,
                along with ‚ÄúHeaven Only Knows.‚Äù It was at the Metro, a sizable
                venue but nothing compared to where Chance would be performing
                at just a year later, and it truly felt like every single person
                there was singing along to this song. I had a similar but much
                larger scale experience a few months later at the Pitchfork
                Festival in Chicago. Chance had really done it; he had the whole
                city behind him with a message of overwhelming positivity.
                ‚ÄúSunday Candy‚Äù is so comfy, especially if you‚Äôve been raised in
                a Christian household, and sharing that nostalgia and joy with
                the city was something I‚Äôll never forget.

              <h5>Lorde, "Perfect Places" (2017)</h5>

              <p>
                Lorde is one of the best pop songwriters of our time,
                particularly when writing about the millennial experiences of
                longing. At once, this song expresses how it feels to not have a
                sense of belonging in the world as well how difficult it is to
                cope with the anxiety of trying to find a place for ourselves.
                The hook of this song is just perfect:
              </p>
              <p class="quote">
                <em>
                  All of the things we‚Äôre taking<br />
                  'cause we are young and we‚Äôre ashamed<br />
                  Send us to perfect places<br />
                  All of our heroes fading<br />
                  Now I can‚Äôt stand to be alone<br />

                </em>
              </p>
              <p>
                It doesn‚Äôt matter who you are, where you grew up, or what you‚Äôre
                into, there is something immensely relatable about this feeling
                and she nails it. The song closes with the sobering realization
                that inevitably follows:
              </p>
              <p class="quote">

              <p>
                Yams and Rocky were so ahead of their time, and it felt that way
                in 2011. They took internet rap mainstream, creating something
                post-regional before that was so commonplace. As much as I found
                the OG internet pioneers like Lil B enjoyable, songs like
                ‚ÄúGoldie‚Äù took it to another level. I liked these songs at the
                time, but it‚Äôs made better today by reflecting on how
                influential all of the stylistic choices of Rocky‚Äôs early music
                and visuals have been throughout the decade. R.I.P. A$AP Yams

                One of my favorite concert memories of the decade was going to a
                Dua Lipa show at a relatively small music festival in Incheon,
                Korea. At the time, this song was blowing up a bit, but Dua Lipa
                was nowhere close to the popstar that she is today. That didn‚Äôt
                matter though.

                As mainstream rap continues to grow away from the traditions and
                styles of the golden age era, lots of kids today still prefer
                90s aesthetics. Particularly young rappers, like Joey Bada$$ on
                his first mixtape, capture the same energy that the rap legends
                of the past generation did. It‚Äôs fresh but familiar in a way
                that truly affirms the timelessness of hip hop, and as a fan of
                both generations, that‚Äôs awesome to see.

                Now that I live in socal, this song makes a lot more sense lol.
                Even though it‚Äôs trashy and is the musical equivalent of an
                Asian guy with an undercut and/or perm, I‚Äôll take this over
                anything 88rising has put out this decade. I love my fellow azns
                :^)
